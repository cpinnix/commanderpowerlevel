# Commander Power Level

## Purpose

General idea is to provide the ability to quickly gauge the power level of a commander deck using crowdsourced weights.

There are three weights used to generate three scores: Commander Weights, Power Weights, Pepper and Salt Weights. These weights are maintained in CSV files and can be collaboratively modified in this repository.

## Scores

### Commander Score

The Commander Score is a rough indicator of whole deck synergy power potential. To avoid having a complicated technical system to analyze the power of synergies within a given commander deck, the deck's commander is used as a proxy for a deck's power potential through card interactions.

The Commander Score is a number between 0 and 1000. 1000 being a mythical god commander that can never be beat; it'd probably have an eminence ability that says you win the game at the beginning of your first upkeep or something.

#### Guidelines

##### 0 - 400

##### 400 - 600

##### 600

##### 700

##### 800

##### 900

### Power Score

The Power Score for an individual card indicates how generically powerful it is within the commander format. The Power Score for a deck indicates how generically powerful a deck is within the commander format. There are cards in commander that can be placed in pretty much any deck and increase the power level of the deck. There are also cards that are generically weak like basic lands.

The Power Score is a number between 0 and 1000. Each card has a Power Weight between 0 and 10. 100 cards in a deck multiplied by all the weights will give the total Power Score for a deck.

##### 0 - 200

##### 200 - 400

##### 500 - 600

##### 600 - 800

##### 800 - 1000
